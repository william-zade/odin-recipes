            <p><h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2></p>
                
            <p><h3>How to prepare dried fernbrake for use:</h3></p>

            <img src="/home/william/repos/odin-recipes/images/gosari.jpg" alt="cooked fernbrake, also known as gosari in Hangul">
                
                <p>If you have presoaked or fresh fernbrake you can use it straight away, but if you have dried fernbrake you'll need to get it ready to eat.  It's fast if you have a pressure cooker, but if you don't it will take some time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>With a Pressure cooker</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash 1/2 oz. of dried gosari and boil it with 5 cups of water in a pressure cooker for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Drain and rinse in cold water a couple of times.</li>
                    <li>Drain. It should make about 4 oz.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>In a pot on the stove</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large saucepan add 1/2 oz of dried gosari to 7 cups of waterr. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and boil for 30 minutes. Cover and let stand until cool, roughly 2-3 hours.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the fernbrake a couple of times, drain and put in a bowl. Cover with frewsh cold water and let soak for at least 8 hours or overnight in a cool place, changing the water 2 or 3 times during the soaking.</li>
                    <li>Taste the gosari: it should be soft. If it's tough, boil it again in a fresh pot of water for about 20 minutes and then let it sit, covered, until soft.</li>
                    <li>Drain. It should make about 4 oz.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><h3>Make the Rice</h3></p>

                <p>If you have a usual method for making rice or have a rice cooker, go ahead and make 5 cups of rice like you usually do.  But here's how I do it in a pot on the stove. 2 cups of dried rice makes about 5 cups of cooked rice.</p>
                <ol>    
                    <li>Rinse 2 cups of rice in cold water and scrub the wet rice with your hand. Rinse and drain until the drained water is pretty clear.</li>
                    <li>Put the rice in a heavy bottomed pot. Add 2 cups of water, cover, and soak for about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Cook over medium-high heat for 7-88 minutes until the surface is covered with abundant bubbles that are spluttering noisily and look like they're about to overflow the pot.  Turn the rrice over a few times with a spoon and coverr the pot again.</li>
                    <li>Turn the heat to very low and simmer for another 10 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy. Remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Fluff the rice with a poon to release excess steam. Let the rice stand, covered, at room temperature to keep it warm.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><h2>Prepare and cook the ingredients for bibimbap</h2></p>

                <p>I like to get a big platter and then put each vegetable on it as they're ready. I think it looks pretty, but you don't have to do this.  When all vegetables are prepared and ready for use, the platter looks delicious!</p>
                
                <P><strong>Soybean Sprouts:</strong></P>
                    
                <img src="/home/william/repos/odin-recipes/images/soybean_sprouts.jpg" alt="cooked soybean spouts">

                <ol>
                    <li>Put the soy bean sprouts in a pot and add 4 cups water and 2-3 teaspoons salt. Cover and cook for 20 minutes over medium-high heat. Take out the sprouts with tongs and put them into a bowl, leaveing about 1/2 cup of sprouts in the pot with the water you used to boil them. This is the soup to serve with the bibimbap later.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, mix the sprouts by hand with 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon garrlic, 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds. Cover and put it next to the soy bean sprouts on the platter.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><h3>Other fresh vegetables:</h3></p>
                
                <img src="/home/william/repos/odin-recipes/images/carrot.jpg" alt="carrot cut into matchsticks">

                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the carrot into matchsticks, put them in a bowl, and mix with a pinch of salt. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until sweating.</li>
                    <li>Cut the red bell pepper into halves, deseed, and slice into strips. Put them in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Cut the zucchini into matchsticks and mix with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
                    <li>Cut the cucumber into halves lengthwise and slice thinly crosswise. Mix with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Beef:</strong></p> 
                
                <img src="/home/william/repos/odin-recipes/images/beef.jpg" alt="bowl of beef cut into strips and seasoned">
                
                <ol>   
                    <li>Cut the beef into matchsticks and put them in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Mix with 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon honey (or sugar), 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon sesame seeds with a spoon.</li>
                    <li>Cover and keep in the fridge until ready for use.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Mountain vegetables:</strong></p>
                
                <img src="/home/william/repos/odin-recipes/images/vegetables.jpg" alt="plattered vegetables ready to be used for making bibimbap">
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the fernbrake (gosari) a few times into bite size pieces. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Put the bellflower roots (dojari) in a large bowl. Add 1-2 tablespoons salt. Rub for a minute to wilt slightly and release some fo the bitterness. Rinse them in cold water a couple of times and drain. If you find some roots are to thick, split them lengthwise. Set aside.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><h2><strong>Let's Cook!</strong></h2></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a pan over medium-high heat. Squeeze out excess water from the carrot. Add a few drops of cooking oil to the pan and saute the carrot for 1 minute. Put on the platter next to the soy bean sprouts and spinach. Clean the pan with wet paper towel or wash it.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan with a few drops of cooking oil and squeeze the excess water from the cucumber. Saute with 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic and a few drops of rtasted sesame oil for 30 seconds. Put it on the platter and clean the pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat up the pan with a few drops of cooking oil.  Add the red bell pepper and sprinkle a pinch of salt over the top. Saute for 30 seconds. Put on the platter and clean the pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan and squeeze the excess water from the zucchini. Add a few drops of cooking oil and saute with 1 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 tablespoon chopped green onion, a drop of toasted sesame oil for 1 minute until slightly softened. Put on the platter and clean the pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan with a few drops of cooking oil. Add the bellflower roots and saute for 2-3 minutes. Lower the heat to medium so as no to brown them. Add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic and a drop of toasted sesame oil. Stir for another minute until a little softened. Put on the platter and clean the pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan, add a few drops of cooking oil. Add the gosari and stir for 2 minutes until a little softened. Add 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 2 teaspoon sugar, stir for another minute. Put on the platter, clean the pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan and add a few drops of cooking oil. Add the beef and pan fry to desired level, set aside and clean pan.</li>
                    <li>Heat the pan and add a few drops of cooking oil. Gently fry 4 eggs, one at a time, either over easy or sunny side up.  Set to the side, clean pan.<em>
                    *Note that traditionally bibimbap is normally served with a raw yolk for the egg and the beef is usually dished raw and allowed to cook in the soup.*</em></li>
