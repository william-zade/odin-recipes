Added image to index.html
Added <ul> <ol> to bibimbap.html
Added images to bibimbap.html

Discovered that img tags on Github deployment don't work

I need to continue working on getting my commit habit down and in a logical way.  I've discovered a couple different ways to make my commits and that has become part of my problem with not remembering how to properly commit messages on projects.  I still need to figure out why my img tags don't work when I deploy my website from GitHub, that will be my next issue to handle.  I think I have a firmer grasp now of how to build the structure of a site, adding pictures and links, though I still struggle with relative paths and have come to rely on copying absolute paths.  For now I don't see the problem with primarily using absolute paths, but getting down relative paths is definitely going to be a useful time saver moving forward and I will build several more similar projects on my own to get it down and understand how to make that function correctly.
